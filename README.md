# Final Project for Postgraduate Studies in Data Science

Data Analysis Project Using ML Algorithms (Python, Kaggle)

## Mushroom Classification – Final Project

The project involves classifying mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous** based on descriptive data.

## Data

- Number of instances: **8124**
- Number of features: **22**
- Classes: edible (51.8%) vs poisonous (48.2%)

Data source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom)

## Used Algorithms

1. Logistic Regression
2. KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)
3. SVM – linear, polynomial, and sigmoid versions
4. Naive Bayes classifier
5. Decision Trees
6. Random Forest

---

## Results

- **KNN** and **Random Forest** achieved perfect accuracy.
- **SVM (sigmoid)** made errors classifying poisonous mushrooms as edible.
- **Logistic Regression** and **SVM (linear)** performed very well.
- More details in the `SUMMARY.md` file.
